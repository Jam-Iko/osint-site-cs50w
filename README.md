# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For Project0 I have developed a web-site dedicated to Information Security and Open Source Intelligence.

Project includes:
HTML files:
	-index.html (General information about OSINT. Bootstrap elements used: card, columns)
	-tools.html (Links and description of the most popular OSINT tools. Bootstrap elements used: borderless table)
	-quiz.html (Suggests to take a quiz on how well the user protects their personal data)
	--->game.html (User gets to this page after pressing button on 'quiz.html'. This page hosts quiz questions and answer options)
	--->--->result.html (Page to host personalized results after completing the quiz and list of recommendations for better protection of personal data. Bootstrap elements used: list-group).
	On each page:
	-navigation bar with options to get to Home, Tools and Quiz pages, created using Bootstrap's navbar-brand
	-Bootstrap's classes: "jumbotron jumbotron-fluid", "display-4" and "lead"
Javascript files (./scripts):
	-game.js (Quiz functionality, based on additional online course, link to original source  included)
	-result.js (Functionality to show personilized results, based on number of correct answers provided by the user)
CSS and SCSS files (./styles):
	-stylesheet0.css (Created using Sass, setting primary colors for background and text used in the project)
	-styles.css (Stylesheet for all pages except game.html)
